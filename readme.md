This repository includes implementations of supervised learning methods (SVR-MLP) to predict mechanical parameters. <br>
A dataset was provided by Universit√© Gustave Eiffel and I had to make some predictions as a research intern. The goal was to replicate the results from a PhD thesis [(Tinoco)](https://www.proquest.com/openview/171f3c95ef0aca3ae73da8b8c725a87e/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=2026366). <br>
The dataset is not included in the public repository for now, according to one of my supervisor's request. <br>. The main challenge is the scarcity of data ; only 186 samples are available to make the predictions.

At this date the internship is still ongoing and the repository is still under development. <br>
The notebooks ([svm.ipynb](svm.ipynb), [MLP.ipynb](MLP.ipynb)) include explanations for the choices of the hyperparameters (I used the same procedure as the one described in Tinoco's thesis). <br>
The python files ([svm.py](svm.py), [MLP.py](MLP.py)) are scripts with the same code as in the notebooks.
